# Wireshark Network Malware Analysis Lab

## Objective 
The objective of this lab is to determine if a system has been infected with malware, trace the origin of the infection, identify the type of malware, and respond to some general malware-related questions.
This lab is going to be used to show my ability with corporate forensic tools for identification purposes, alongside a more advanced skillset using wireshark.

(Objective Questions)

## Summary 
In this project I conducted a PCAP (Packet Capture) analysis with the objective of being able to identify the presence of malware, its origin, and its type. The analysis was conducted using forensic tools like Wireshark, Zui, and VirusTotal. All lab work was conducted in a Kali Linux environment as well. 

Key steps in the investigation included configuring Wireshark to display the source and destination ports, setting the time frame as UTC to ensure there was consistency of collected datasets. Inspecting protocol hierarchy to identify network traffic, this included HTTP, DNS, and TLS. Conversations between IP addresses were also investigated, IP addresses were identified by packet count. 

VirusTotal was used to cross-check domains and IP addresses of interest. Some domains in the Lab, such as cochrimato.com, were marked malicious, while others returned clean results. Analysis was also performed on GET requests for files like spet10.spr and ojw.avi, which indicated the transmission of malicious binaries and executables. 

The investigation was very helpful in furthering my knowledge on what to look for in PCAP files, how to ensure datasets are uniform and readable, as well as how to dig deeper into packets to be able to identify malicious binary content.
