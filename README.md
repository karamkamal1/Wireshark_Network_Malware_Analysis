# Wireshark Network Malware Analysis Lab

## Objective 
The objective of this lab is to determine if a system has been infected with malware, trace the origin of the infection, identify the type of malware, and respond to some general malware-related questions.
This lab is going to be used to show my ability with corporate forensic tools for identification purposes, alongside a more advanced skillset using wireshark.

(Objective Questions)

## Summary 
In this project, I conducted a thorough PCAP (Packet Capture) analysis to investigate a malware infection. The primary objective is to identify the presence of malware, its origin, and its type. The analysis was conducted using various forensic tools, including Wireshark, Zui, and VirusTotal, all work was conducted in a Kali Linux environment.

Key steps in the investigation included configuring Wireshark to display the source and destination ports, setting time frames as UTC to ensure the consistencey of collected datasets, and inspecting protocol hierarchy to identify network traffic, including HTTP, DNS, and TLS. Conversations between IP addresses were investigated, with focus on IP addresses by packet count. 

VirusTotal was used to cross-check domains and IP addresses of interest. Some domains, such as cochrimato.com, were marked malicious, while others returned clean results. Further analysis was performed on GET requests for files like spet10.spr and ojw.avi, which suggested the transmission of malicious binaries and executables.

The investigation was meticulous, tracking suspicious packet exchanges, highlighting critical timestamps, and investigating HTTP requests that may have led to malware delivery. Filters in Wireshark were applied to narrow down the investigation, ensuring precise identification of malware-involved IPs and domains.
